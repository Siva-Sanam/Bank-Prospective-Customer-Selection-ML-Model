# Bank-Prospective-Customer-Selection-ML-Model
## Problem Statement
Universal Bank has begun a program to encourage existing customers to borrow via a consumer loan program. 

The bank has tested a loan promotion on a random sample of 5000 customers. This test promotion resulted in 480 of the 5000 existing customers accepting the offer. 

The bank is intrigued by the success of this promotion. It has hired you to help them develop a model to identify which of its remaining customers may accept a similar promotion. 

They hired you to help them reduce the promotion costs and target the offer to only a subset of its customers that or more likely to accept the offer. They disclosed that the cost to promote this offer is \\$10 dollars per customer, and the profit from obtaining a loan customer is \\$100. They have an additional 50,000 customers that have not been contacted about the promotion.
